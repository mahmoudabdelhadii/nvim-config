# jordan-nvim

Started off with nvim kickstart (would highly recommend)

Most important plugins:
- Mini for floating file explorer
- Snacks for pickers (improvement over telescope)
- nvim-cmp for completions (robust, LSP-driven, snippet support)
- Classics of every nvim setup: nvim-lspconfig, treesitter, which-key
- Flash for jumping around and quickly selecting within a given scope
- Gitsigns for on demand git blame and resetting of hunks and buffers
- nvim-dap (+ nvim-dap-ui, nvim-dap-virtual-text) for debugging
- Trouble.nvim for interactive diagnostics list
- nvim-lint for linting (shellcheck, eslint_d, flake8, luacheck, â€¦)
- Gp for on demand AI but not without constant AI suggestions
-- Git diff view (self explanatory)

Things to install first outside of neovim
- fortune (dashboard)
- cowsay (dashboard)
- ripgrep (grugfar, and a couple others)
