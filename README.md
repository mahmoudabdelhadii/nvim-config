# jordan-nvim

Started off with nvim kickstart (would highly recommend)

Most important plugins:
- Mini for floating file explorer
- Snacks for pickers (Improvement over telescope)
- Blink cmp for completions (improvement over nvim-cmp)
- Classics of every nvim setup: nvim-lspconfig, treesiter, which-key
- Flash for jumping around and quickly selecting within a given scope
- Gitsigns for on demand git blame and resetting of hunks and buffers
- Gp for on demand AI but not without constant AI suggestions
- Git diff view (self explanatory)

Things to install first outside of neovim
- fortune (dashboard)
- cowsay (dashboard)
- ripgrep (grugfar, and a couple others)
